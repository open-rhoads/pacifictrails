                <h3>Our Journey</h3>
                <p>
                    Pacific Trails resort strives to provide first class hospitality to guests of all ages.
                    We focus on curating a customizable experience with a variety of trails to explore and
                    activities to immerse yourself in. Whether you prefer to relax along the beach after 
                    a scenic hike, hit the waves in one of our kayaks, or enjoy the diverse nature; Pacific Trails
                    has something for you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The vision of Pacific Trails took root from a family who bonded over 
                    camping trips in nature. Originally from Northern California, the family
                    traveled with their children and niece by RV, exploring the vast beauty of the
                    American West. Through their adventurous spirit, the idea of Pacific Trails 
                    was born.
